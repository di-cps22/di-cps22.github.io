                  <p>Social distancing has become a pressing and challenging issue during the Covid-19
                     pandemic. In a smart cities context, it becomes possible to measure inter-personal
                     distance using networked cameras and computer vision analysis. We deploy a computer
                     vision pipeline based on Retinanet that identifies pedestrians in streaming video
                     frames, then converts their positions to GPS coordinates for distance calculation
                     and further analysis. This processing is applied to nine camera streams at three locations
                     from around Vanderbilt University. We collect 70 hours of baseline distancing data
                     over the course of two weeks, after which time we deploy small behavioral interventions
                     at the three locations aimed at increasing distancing compliance. Another 70 hours
                     of data with the interventions in place will be analyzed against the baseline data
                     to determine if they had an effect on distancing compliance.</p>

                  <p>The accurate and timely information about parking occupancy and availability has played
                     a crucial role to solve the smart city challenge related to mobility, by helping drivers
                     to save their time and by avoiding waiting to find a space, to move smoothly, or be
                     in traffic. In recent times, there has been growing interest in the use of Big Data
                     and crowd-sourcing data for both research and commercial applications. However, several
                     challenges remain to extract salient information for designing an accurate and timely
                     parking recommendation system (PRS). Differently from the current state of the artwork
                     our PRS extend the application of standard Machine Learning approaches by proposing
                     the application of an additive regression model (Prophet model) fed by parking meters
                     data (parking meters occurrences). The proposed PRS provides timely forecasting until
                     the next month parking occupancy for each different area using different data sources
                     and an additive-based model (Prophet model). The preliminary results related to the
                     forecasting accuracy on a specific area confirmed how the proposed PRS framework is
                     effective and accurate to provide the forecast of parking meters occurrences until
                     the next month, with an R2 score up to 0.51. The obtained results suggest that the
                     proposed approach is a viable solution for providing reliable forecasting of parking
                     occupancy for different areas and different data sources by modeling non-linear, non-periodic,
                     and weekly periodic changes of the parking meter data.</p>

                  <p>The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus protocol is used in modern vehicles for sharing
                     messages between several control units within a vehicle. CAN bus messages are encoded
                     with unknown scheme and decoding these messages provide unlimited access to valuable
                     information that is used in many autonomous vehicles applications. This paper proposes
                     a ROS based package (CAN-to-ROS) for monitoring, recording, and real-time and offline
                     decoding of CAN bus messages. The package is developed in the ROS framework to add
                     modularity and ease of integration with other software, and it is written in C++ to
                     guarantee speed of the execution during run-time. For realtime decoding of CAN bus
                     data, CAN-to-ROS package used in conjunction with other library called Libpanda that
                     provide access to CAN bus message from a vehicle. The package was evaluated and tested
                     on a Raspberry Pi with real CAN bus data from a Toyota RAV4. The results confirm the

                  <p>Modern intelligent urban mobility applications are underpinned by large-scale, multivariate,

                  <p>This paper describes an approach to identify undecoded Controller Area Network (CAN)
                     data from one vehicle, based on the data similarity to previously decoded CAN data
                     from another vehicle. Modern vehicles communicate data and signals from on-board sensors
                     and controllers through the CAN bus. Networked sensors contain information such as
                     wheel speeds, fuel gauges, turn signals, and radar signals. In the effort to use this
                     information and make cars safer through human-in-the-loop CPS, signals on the CAN
                     bus such as wheel speed and radar can be used to support the driver. However, data
                     from the CAN bus are encoded and in some cases compressed, and different car manufacturers
                     use different encoding schemes to represent data on the CAN bus. With hundreds of
                     messages and thousands of possible encoding schemes to consider, it is laborious to
                     identify the unique bits and encoding schemes that represent signals on each vehicle.
                     In this study, we propose a method for training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
                     network on known radar signals from one vehicle manufacturer, a Toyota, and successfully
                     apply the network to identify the encoding for radar signals on a different vehicle,
                     a Honda. By augmenting the training dataset with varied encoding bit boundaries, a
                     small and lightweight LSTM network can learn to recognize radar data across different
                     encoding schemes. The results are an improvement on exhaustive-search algorithms and
                     other methods previously used in the search for such signals.</p>

                  <p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) generally involve time-critical components due to physical
                     dynamics, therefore necessitating high-performance subsystems. This is also true in
                     data collection scenarios to infer physical phenomena. This paper covers Libpanda
                     as an example of a component that has been designed to address performance issues
                     in CPS implementations. Libpanda is a C++ library that interfaces software with a
                     Comma.ai Panda device. Pandas are used for installation in modern vehicles to read
                     the vehicle CAN bus, providing rich sensor data and limited vehicle control through
                     message injection. The motivation to design lib-panda stems from the lack of performance
                     in Python-based code that runs on inexpensive hardware like a Raspberry Pi. In such
                     situations, Python code would result in utilizing 92% CPU while also dropping around
                     40% of the CAN packet due to bottlenecks. Without using different tools, inconsistent
                     data collection means a loss of time-based vehicle state interpretation. Libpanda
                     addresses these issues through implementation in a different language and implementation
                     of different design paradigms involving asynchronous calls and multithreading. The
                     Panda also features a GPS module that allows multiple instances to synchronize clocks
                     for large-scale data collection scenarios. Libpanda has been designed with time-synchronization
                     in mind to aid in the measurement of inter-vehicle dynamics. The performance improvements
                     of libpanda have resulted in it becoming an important component in automotive dynamics
                     research that requires a higher technical performance in large-scale experiments.</p>

                  <p>This work presents an integrated framework of: vehicle dynamics models, with a particular
                     attention to instabilities and traffic waves; vehicle energy models, with particular
                     attention to accurate energy values for strongly unsteady driving profiles; and sparse
                     Lagrangian controls via automated vehicles, with a focus on controls that can be executed
                     via existing technology such as adaptive cruise control systems. This framework serves
                     as a key building block in developing control strategies for human-in-the-loop traffic
                     flow smoothing on real highways. In this contribution, we outline the fundamental
                     merits of integrating vehicle dynamics and energy modeling into a single framework,
                     and we demonstrate the energy impact of sparse flow smoothing controllers via simulation
                     results.</p>
